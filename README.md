## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded on-demand using React.lazy()
- **Memoization**: React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback for optimal rendering
- **Custom Hooks**: Centralized state management with useTaskManager
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Graceful loading states throughout the application

### State Management
- **useTaskManager Hook**: Centralized task operations with error handling
- **useLocalStorage Hook**: Persistent state across browser sessions
- **useDebounce Hook**: Optimized input handling for better performance
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling and recovery

### Component Architecture
- **TaskCard Component**: Memoized individual task rendering
- **LoadingSpinner**: Specialized loading states for different contexts
- **ErrorBoundary**: Catches and displays errors gracefully
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with TailwindCSS

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 3 + Custom CSS animations
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth, physics-based animations
- **Build Tool**: Create React App
- **State Management**: React Hooks + Custom Hooks
- **Persistence**: Local Storage with custom hooks
- **Performance**: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, lazy loading
